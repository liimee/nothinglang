### nothinglang
The most useless programming language ever with a complicated syntax  
and yes, everything is linux 🐧  
it's case-sensitive anyways  

Nothinglang compiles to JS, so JS errors also, obviously exist.  
And, obviously, it's really bad

[🦕 Deno Version Guide](dguide.md)

If you feel like the web version is so bad, then use the deno version:
```shell
deno run --allow-read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liimee/nothinglang/nothinglang/deno.js filename.nothing
```
(make sure the --allow-read flag exist)

More stuff soon  
~~I might also remove the alert (and other browser-only stuff) part so it works on non-browsers~~ apparently deno supports those stuff  
PRs/issues are welcome :D
