### nothinglang
The most useless programming language ever with a complicated syntax  
and yes, everything is linux 🐧  
it's case-sensitive anyways  

Nothinglang compiles to JS, so JS errors also, obviously exist.  
And, obviously, it's really bad

The Deno version is now available!

PRs/issues are welcome :D
