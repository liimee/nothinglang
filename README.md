### nothinglang
The most useless programming language ever  
and yes, everything is linux  
it's case-sensitive anyways  

Nothinglang compiles to JS, so JS errors also, obviously exist.  
And, obviously, it's really bad

If you feel like the web version is so bad, then use the deno version:
```shell
deno run --allow-read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liimee/nothinglang/nothinglang/deno.js filename.js
```
(make sure the --allow-read flag exist)

More stuff soon  
I might also remove the alert (and other browser-only stuff) part so it works on non-browsers  
PRs are welcome :D
