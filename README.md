# nothinglang
a useless programming language that just "works"  
and yes, everything is linux 🐧  
it's case-sensitive anyways  

Nothinglang compiles to JS, so JS errors also, obviously exist.  
And, obviously, it's really bad

More stuff soon  
**It's really bad so use at your own risk**. 
~~I might also remove the alert (and other browser-only stuff) part so it works on non-browsers~~ apparently deno supports those stuff  
PRs/issues are welcome :D

Also — I might move this repo to my GitLab soon
